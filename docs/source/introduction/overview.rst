What is AI-Guard?
================

AI-Guard is an advanced security system that leverages artificial intelligence for real-time face detection and recognition. It's designed to enhance physical security in institutional settings by automating the identification of authorized personnel and detecting unauthorized individuals attempting to access secure areas.

Motivation and real-world problem it solves
==========================================

Traditional security systems often rely on manual verification by security personnel or simple card-based access systems that can be lost, stolen, or shared. AI-Guard solves these problems by using biometric face recognition that:

- Cannot be forgotten, lost, or easily shared
- Works passively without requiring user interaction
- Creates a reliable audit trail of all entry attempts
- Provides real-time alerts for unauthorized access attempts
- Reduces human error in security monitoring

Key benefits
===========

- **Enhanced Security**: Biometric verification provides more reliable identification than cards or PINs
- **Automation**: Reduces need for manual security checks while improving accuracy
- **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notification of security events for rapid response
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed records of all access attempts for audit and investigation
- **Integration**: Works with existing security infrastructure and systems

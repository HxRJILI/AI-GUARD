High-Level Overview

System Flow
==========

The AI-Guard system follows this general flow:

1. Camera captures video feed at entry points
2. Face detection module identifies human faces in the frame
3. Face recognition module extracts features and creates embeddings
4. Comparison engine matches embeddings against authorized database
5. Decision system determines if access should be granted
6. Notification service alerts security personnel for unauthorized attempts
7. Logging system records all events for future reference

System Components
===============

The AI-Guard system consists of several key components working together:

Client Components
----------------
- **Enrollment Interface**: Web application for capturing and registering new faces
- **Admin Dashboard**: Interface for system configuration, user management, and monitoring
- **Security Console**: Real-time display of entry attempts and alerts

Backend Components
----------------
- **REST API**: Handles requests from clients and coordinates between services
- **Face Detection Service**: Identifies and localizes faces in images
- **Face Recognition Service**: Generates embeddings and performs matching
- **Notification Service**: Sends alerts through various channels (email, SMS, push)
- **Database**: Stores user information, face embeddings, and access logs
- **Object Storage**: Stores facial images and event recordings

Edge Devices
-----------
- **Jetson Nano**: Runs lightweight detection models at entry points
- **Raspberry Pi**: Manages camera feeds and initial preprocessing

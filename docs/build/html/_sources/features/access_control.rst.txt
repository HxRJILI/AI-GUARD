Permission Model
==============

The system implements a granular permission model:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Example permission structure

   permissions = {
       "system": {
           "configure": ["Administrator"],
           "view_status": ["Administrator", "Security Officer"]
       },
       "users": {
           "create": ["Administrator", "Security Officer"],
           "view": ["Administrator", "Security Officer", "Enrollment Officer", "Auditor"],
           "modify": ["Administrator", "Security Officer"],
           "delete": ["Administrator"]
       },
       "enrollment": {
           "create": ["Administrator", "Security Officer", "Enrollment Officer"],
           "view": ["Administrator", "Security Officer", "Enrollment Officer"],
           "delete": ["Administrator", "Security Officer"]
       },
       # Additional permission groups...
   }

Access Levels
===========

Beyond roles, the system supports variable access levels for physical locations:

- **Level 0**: Public areas (no verification required)
- **Level 1**: General access areas (basic verification)
- **Level 2**: Restricted areas (strict verification)
- **Level 3**: High-security areas (multi-factor authentication)
- **Level 4**: Critical areas (approval workflow required)

Each user can be assigned different access levels for different areas.

Time-Based Restrictions
=====================

Access can be further restricted by time:

- Regular working hours
- After-hours access permissions
- Weekend/holiday special rules
- Temporary access grants
- Emergency override procedures

Role Management
=============

Administrators can manage roles through:

- Creating custom roles with specific permissions
- Assigning users to roles
- Modifying role permissions
- Setting up role hierarchies
- Implementing approval workflows for role changes

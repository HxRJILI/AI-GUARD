Data Security

Measures to protect sensitive data within the AI-GUARD system.

Encryption At Rest
================

Database Encryption
-----------------

- Full database encryption using PostgreSQL's encryption features
- Tablespace-level encryption for sensitive tables
- Encryption of backup files
- Secure key storage separate from database backups

Face Embedding Encryption
-----------------------

- AES-256-GCM encryption for all biometric data
- Unique encryption key per embedding
- Master key rotation every 90 days
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) for key protection

File System Encryption
--------------------

- Full disk encryption for all storage volumes
- Encrypted object storage for images and video
- Secure wipe procedures for deleted data
- Separate encryption domains for different data types

Encryption In Transit
==================

Internal Communications
--------------------

- TLS 1.3 for all internal service communications
- Certificate-based mutual authentication between services
- Automatic certificate rotation
- Strong cipher suites (TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)

External Communications
--------------------

- HTTPS with TLS 1.3 for all external API access
- HSTS implementation
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- Certificate transparency monitoring

Data Minimization
===============

- Face embeddings stored instead of actual images
- Automatic pruning of temporary processing files
- Configurable retention periods for logs and events
- Anonymization of data for analytical purposes

Project Scope
=============

Main goals
=========

AI-Guard has been developed with several key objectives in mind:

- **Enhanced Security**: Provide biometric-level verification of identity without requiring physical tokens or cards
- **Automation**: Reduce the need for manual security checks while improving accuracy
- **Real-time Alerts**: Instantly notify security personnel of unauthorized access attempts
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintain detailed records of all entry attempts with timestamps and images
- **Scalability**: Support deployment across multiple entry points and buildings

Technical scope
=============

The AI-Guard system encompasses:

1. **Face Detection**: Identifying and localizing faces in video streams
2. **Face Recognition**: Matching detected faces against a database of authorized users
3. **Access Control**: Decision-making based on recognition results and security policies
4. **Notification System**: Alerting security personnel of relevant events
5. **Management Interface**: Administration, monitoring, and reporting tools
6. **Edge Computing**: On-device processing for low-latency recognition

Out of scope
===========

To maintain focus and ensure quality, the following areas are considered outside the scope of the current AI-Guard system:

- General object detection (non-facial)
- Behavioral analysis or anomaly detection
- Integration with physical access control hardware (locks, gates)
- Voice recognition or other biometric methods
- Long-term video storage or CCTV functionality

Institutions this applies to
==========================

AI-Guard was initially developed for deployment at ENSAM (École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers), but is suitable for a wide range of institutional settings including:

- Educational institutions (universities, research centers)
- Corporate offices and facilities
- Government buildings
- Healthcare facilities
- Data centers
- Any facility requiring controlled physical access
